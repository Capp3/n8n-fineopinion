# Multi-Agent Workflow Design - CREATIVE MODE

**Created:** October 9, 2025  
**Mode:** CREATIVE  
**Status:** Design Phase  
**Complexity:** Level 4 - Advanced Multi-Agent System

---

## üé≠ Vision: News Organization Agent Pipeline

Inspired by traditional news organization roles, this multi-agent system processes financial news through specialized agents, each with a distinct role and expertise.

---

## üéØ Core Design Philosophy

### Facts First, Character Second

The multi-agent workflow is built on a crucial separation:

**üóûÔ∏è JOURNALIST = FACTS FIRST**

- Objective, factual reporting only
- What happened, when, who, where, how much
- NO speculation, NO opinion, NO interpretation
- Think: Wire service reporting
- _"Just the facts. Always the facts."_

**‚úçÔ∏è EDITORIAL = CHARACTER & FUN**

- Perspective, analysis, personality
- WHY it matters, SO WHAT factor
- Make it engaging, interesting, enjoyable
- Add wit and character (stay classy)
- Think: Smart friend explaining economics
- _"Make them care - and smile while reading."_

This separation ensures:

- **Factual Integrity**: Facts are never mixed with opinion
- **Clear Voice**: FineOpinions has personality where it belongs
- **Modularity**: Can adjust character/tone without changing factual reporting
- **Quality**: Each agent does one thing excellently

### Prompt Engineering

```markdown
SYSTEM:
You are a Wire Service Financial Journalist. Your job is **FACTS ONLY** - no speculation, no opinion, just clear factual reporting. You receive processed article summaries from your desk reporters and must craft a coherent factual narrative.

**CRITICAL RULES - FACTS ONLY:**

- ONLY report what HAPPENED - no speculation about why or what it means
- NO opinions, NO analysis, NO predictions - the Editorial Writer will handle that
- Use ACTIVE, DECLARATIVE statements: "The Fed raised rates by 0.25%" not "The Fed may have raised rates"
- Present FACTS in logical, chronological order
- Include NUMBERS, DATES, and ENTITIES - specifics matter ("increased 3.2%" not "increased significantly")
- If sources disagree, report BOTH facts: "Reuters reported X. Bloomberg reported Y."
- NO interpretation of sentiment or implications - just the facts

Your responsibilities:

- Identify the 3-5 most important factual developments of the period
- Present facts in clear, logical narrative order
- Connect related events factually (what led to what, when observable)
- Note any conflicting factual reports
- Highlight critical data points and market movements
- Create smooth transitions between topics
- Keep it crisp, clear, and factual

Output your synthesis as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

"theme": "Main theme/topic",
"importance": "critical|high|medium",

## üéØ Design Decisions

### 1. Agent Separation Rationale

**Why 4 distinct agents instead of 1-2?**

- **Desk Reporter**: Focused, fact-based analysis. Fast processing. Parallelizable.
- **Journalist**: Higher-level synthesis. Requires seeing all articles together.
- **Editorial Writer**: Analytical depth. Different skill set from journalist.
- **Copywriter**: Presentation focus. Transforms content into engaging prose.

**Benefits**:

- **Modularity**: Each agent can be tested, refined, and replaced independently
- **Quality**: Specialized prompts produce better results than general-purpose prompts
- **Flexibility**: Can skip Editorial or Copywriter if needed for speed
- **Parallel Processing**: Desk Reporters run in parallel for efficiency

**Tradeoffs**:

- **Complexity**: More agents = more prompts to maintain
- **Token Usage**: Multiple LLM calls increase costs (mitigated by using local Ollama)
- **Processing Time**: Sequential agents add latency (mitigated by parallelizing Desk Reporters)

### 2. Model Selection Strategy

| Agent            | Primary Model                                                    | Rationale                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Desk Reporter    | `llama3.2:3b` (small articles)<br/>`qwen2.5:7b` (large articles) | Balance speed vs. quality based on article size |
| Journalist       | `qwen2.5:7b`                                                     | Requires higher reasoning for synthesis         |
| Editorial Writer | `qwen2.5:7b` or `qwen2.5:14b`                                    | Needs nuanced analytical thinking               |
| Copywriter       | `qwen2.5:7b`                                                     | Quality prose generation                        |

### 3. Frequency & Scheduling

**Twice Daily Execution**:

- **Morning Cycle (7 AM)**: Process overnight news (12-hour window)
- **Evening Cycle (7 PM)**: Process daytime news (12-hour window)

**Agent Timing**:

1. **Desk Reporters**: 5-10 minutes (parallel processing)
2. **Journalist**: 2-3 minutes (synthesis)
3. **Editorial Writer**: 2-3 minutes (analysis)
4. **Copywriter**: 1-2 minutes (formatting)

**Total Processing**: ~10-18 minutes per cycle

### 4. Error Handling & Fallbacks

Each agent has fallback strategies:

- **Desk Reporter Fails**: Store minimal data (title, source, relevance=0)
- **Journalist Fails**: Use simple concatenation of Desk Reporter headlines
- **Editorial Writer Fails**: Skip editorial layer, proceed to Copywriter
- **Copywriter Fails**: Send raw Journalist synthesis with basic formatting

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Individual Agent Testing

Test each agent with sample data:

1. **Desk Reporter**: Test with 10 sample articles (varied sources, topics)
2. **Journalist**: Test with 20-30 Desk Reporter outputs
3. **Editorial Writer**: Test with 5 Journalist syntheses
4. **Copywriter**: Test with 5 Editorial outputs

**Success Criteria**:

- Valid JSON output (100% of tests)
- Appropriate relevance scoring (Desk Reporter)
- Coherent narrative (Journalist, Editorial)
- 3-5 minute read time (Copywriter)

### Phase 2: End-to-End Testing

Run complete workflow with live RSS feeds:

1. Process 1 news cycle (12 hours of articles)
2. Validate each agent's output
3. Measure total processing time
4. Review final email quality

**Success Criteria**:

- All agents complete successfully
- Total processing < 20 minutes
- Final email is coherent and valuable
- No critical errors

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement

Based on initial results:

1. Adjust prompts for quality
2. Optimize model selection
3. Refine output schemas
4. Improve error handling

## üîÑ Weekly Report Integration (Future)

The multi-agent system sets up perfectly for weekly reports:

**Weekly Report Agent**:

- Reads 14 DailyDigests (morning + evening for 7 days)
- Identifies weekly themes and trends
- Creates analytical weekly report
- Uses same Editorial Writer ‚Üí Copywriter pattern

## üé® Next Steps: From CREATIVE to BUILD

1. ‚úÖ **CREATIVE MODE COMPLETE**: Multi-agent workflow designed
2. **Update Architecture Document**: Incorporate multi-agent design
3. **Update tasks.md**: Break down implementation by agent
4. **Enter BUILD MODE**: Implement Desk Reporter first (Phase 1)
5. **Iterative Development**: Add agents sequentially

---

**Design Status:** ‚úÖ CREATIVE DESIGN COMPLETE  
**Recommended Next Mode:** üîÑ Update Planning Documents ‚Üí üî® BUILD MODE  
**First Implementation:** Agent 1 (Desk Reporter)
