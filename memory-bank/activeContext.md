   - Create comprehensive system architecture diagram
   - Document information retention policy details

3. **Prompt Engineering Strategy** (Following architecture)

## Current Decisions & Open Questions

### Decisions Made

‚úÖ **Project Structure**

- Memory Bank separate from docs folder
- tasks.md in root as single source of truth
- Use context7 (as per user preference)

‚úÖ **Scope Management**

- Social media monitoring explicitly deferred to future
- Focus on core RSS-based workflow first
- Future features section established

‚úÖ **Technical Principles**

- n8n native nodes preferred
- AI Agent nodes for LLM interaction (avoid provider-specific)
- Ollama for local, low-power LLM inference
- Mermaid diagrams for visualization

### Open Decisions

‚ùì **Database Choice** (High Priority)

- **Options:** Airtable vs PostgreSQL vs PostgreSQL+PGVector
- **Considerations:**
  - Airtable: Fastest MVP, easier inspection
  - PostgreSQL: Production-ready, no API limits
  - PGVector: Future-proof for semantic search
- **Decision Needed By:** Architecture Planning phase
- **Approach:** Evaluate based on:
  - MVP speed requirements
  - Long-term scalability needs
  - PGVector value for semantic search
  - Complexity tolerance

‚ùì **Ollama Model Selection** (Medium Priority)

- **Options:** mistral, llama2, phi, qwen, others
- **Decision Needed By:** Creative Mode (Prompt Engineering)
- **Approach:** Test with sample articles in Creative Mode
- **Criteria:**
  - Inference speed (<30s per digest)
  - Output quality (coherent, analytical)
  - Context window (sufficient for articles)
  - Resource usage (consumer hardware friendly)

‚ùì **Scraping Strategy Details** (Medium Priority)

- **Primary:** HTTP Request Node (straightforward)
- **Fallback:** Browser automation needed?
- **Decision Needed By:** Implementation phase
- **Approach:** Test with actual feed samples
  - Test Economist articles
  - Test Bloomberg articles
  - Test Reuters articles
  - Document which need browser automation

‚ùì **Email Delivery Schedule** (Low Priority)

- **Weekly Reports:** Confirmed
- **Daily Digests:** Email or database only?
- **Decision Needed By:** Implementation phase
- **Current Assumption:** Daily digests stored only, weekly emailed

---

## Context for Next Session

### What Was Achieved

- Complete Memory Bank structure established
- Project scope clearly defined with feature boundaries
- Technical architecture patterns documented
- Task tracking system initialized

### What To Resume

- If continuing PLAN mode:
  - Complete final Memory Bank review
  - Begin Architecture Planning tasks
  - Make database selection decision
- If switching to CREATIVE mode:
  - Prompt engineering for AI agents
  - Ollama model evaluation
  - Scraping strategy testing

### Key Files to Reference

- `/tasks.md` - Task tracking
- `/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Project overview
- `/memory-bank/productContext.md` - Feature scope
- `/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Technical patterns
- `/memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical stack
- `/memory-bank/progress.md` - Implementation tracking

---

## Active Constraints & Reminders

### Must Remember

- ‚úã **NO FEATURE CREEP:** Social media monitoring is deferred
- üéØ **Native Nodes First:** Avoid custom code blocks
- ü§ñ **AI Agent Pattern:** Use AI Agent nodes, not provider-specific nodes
- üîã **Low Power Design:** Optimize for Ollama local models
- üìä **Mermaid Diagrams:** Use for all architectural documentation
- üóÇÔ∏è **Separation:** Memory Bank separate from docs folder

### User Preferences

- Use context7
- Go slow, one thing at a time
- Mermaid diagrams for visualization
- Explicit separation of current vs future features

---

## Workflow State

### Current Workflow

None (planning phase)

### Planned Workflows (Not Yet Created)

1. RSS Ingestion Workflow
2. Content Scraping Workflow
3. Daily Digest Workflow
4. Weekly Report Workflow
5. Data Retention Workflow

---

## Questions for User (If Needed)

### Database Decision Input

When ready for architecture planning, may need user input on:

- Preference for rapid MVP (Airtable) vs production-ready (PostgreSQL)
- Interest in semantic search capabilities (PGVector)
- Comfort level with database setup complexity

### Email Delivery Preference

- Should daily digests also be emailed, or only stored?
- Current assumption: Only weekly reports emailed

### SMTP Configuration

- Does user have SMTP server configured for n8n?
- Or will this be configured during implementation?

---

## Session Notes

### User Intent Observations

- Wants structured, methodical setup
- Values clear separation of concerns
- Prioritizes avoiding feature creep
- Interested in serious creative mode for prompt engineering
- Focused on efficiency (low power, local models)
- Prefers n8n native capabilities

### Architectural Insights

- User has significant infrastructure ready (n8n, Airtable, PostgreSQL, PGVector, Ollama)
- Self-hosted n8n gives full control
- Local LLM preference suggests privacy/cost consciousness
- Multiple database options available provides flexibility

### Risk Observations

- Complexity level 4 requires careful planning (hence PLAN mode)
- Scraping testing will be important (paywall considerations)
- Prompt engineering needs dedicated creative phase
- Model selection impacts quality/performance tradeoff
