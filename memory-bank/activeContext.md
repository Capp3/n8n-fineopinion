## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Every-other-day delivery** (48-hour cycle, 6AM delivery)
2. **4-agent pipeline** (vs. 1-2 general agents)
3. **Airtable database** (rapid MVP, structured data)
4. **Deduplication:** URL hash + title similarity
5. **Pre-filtering:** Relevance >= 4, top 25 to Journalist

### Creative Decisions

1. **"Facts First, Character Second"** philosophy
2. **Northern Irish voice** with edgy humor
3. **Gallows humor allowed** (even for serious topics)
4. **Level 3 accessibility** (assume basic knowledge)
5. **Magazine-style email** structure (flowing narrative)

### Technical Decisions

1. **Wikipedia tool** for Journalist (fact verification)
2. **llama3.2:3b** for fast processing (< 1000 words)
3. **qwen2.5:7b** for quality (>= 1000 words, synthesis)
4. **HTML email** format (rich formatting)
5. **n8n native nodes** preferred (avoid code blocks)

## 🎯 Context for Next Session

### What to Resume (BUILD MODE)

**Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Set Up Airtable** (2-3 hours)

   - Create Articles table (18 fields)
   - Create Digests table (30+ fields)
   - Configure API key in n8n
   - Test CRUD operations

2. **Create Sample Data** (2-3 hours)

   - Find 10 real articles from each RSS source
   - Save full text for testing
   - Vary topics, lengths, complexity

3. **Build n8n Workflow Basics** (4-6 hours)

   - Schedule Trigger nodes (7AM/7PM)
   - RSS Feed Read nodes (4 sources)
   - HTTP Request nodes (content scraping)
   - Test with live feeds

4. **Test Desk Reporter** (3-4 hours)
   - Implement prompt in n8n AI Agent node
   - Test with sample articles
   - Validate JSON outputs
   - Refine if needed

**Reference Documents:**

- `/docs/handoff-october-9-2025.md` - Complete next steps
- `/prompts/desk_reporter.md` - First agent to implement
- `/memory-bank/multi-agent-workflow-design.md` - Architecture reference

## 🔍 Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Resolved ✅

- ✅ Database choice → Airtable
- ✅ Delivery frequency → Every other day
- ✅ Editorial voice → Northern Irish, edgy
- ✅ Relevance threshold → 4
- ✅ Accessibility level → Level 3
- ✅ Email format → HTML, magazine-style
- ✅ Subject line style → Edgy

### Pending (For BUILD Mode) ⏳

- ⏳ Journalist chunking needed? (test with 25 articles)
- ⏳ Which sources need browser automation? (test scraping)
- ⏳ Email client compatibility? (test HTML rendering)
- ⏳ Ollama models available? (verify llama3.2:3b, qwen2.5:7b installed)
- ⏳ SMTP configured in n8n? (for email delivery)

---

## 🚨 Active Constraints & Reminders

### Must Remember

- ✋ **NO FEATURE CREEP:** Focus on core 4-agent pipeline
- 🎯 **Native Nodes First:** Use n8n native nodes where possible
- 🤖 **AI Agent Pattern:** Use AI Agent nodes for LLMs
- 🔋 **Low Power Design:** Optimize for Ollama local inference
- 📊 **Documentation:** Keep docs updated as we build
- 🍀 **Voice Preservation:** Don't sanitize Editorial's edge

### User Preferences

- Use context7 (confirmed)
- Go slow, one thing at a time (worked well today!)
- Ask questions before implementation (prevents rework)
- Document everything (comprehensive docs created)
- Mermaid diagrams for visualization (7+ created)

---

## 🎭 The FineOpinions Voice (Remember This!)

**Journalist:** Wire service facts, no opinion, no speculation  
**Editorial:** Northern Irish wit, edgy, crude humor allowed, gallows humor fair game

**Examples preserved in:** `/prompts/editorial.md` (60+ transformations)

**Key phrase:** "The facts tell you WHAT happened. The editorial tells you WHY you should care - and makes you smile while reading."
