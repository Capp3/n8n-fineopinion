## 🍀 The Voice in 3 Rules

1. **JOURNALIST = FACTS** (no opinion, no speculation)
2. **EDITORIAL = CHARACTER** (Northern Irish wit, edgy, fun)
3. **Don't sanitize** (crude language is intentional)

**3. GDP Data:**

- ❌ "GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 2.4%"
- ✅ "The economy grew 2.4% - not spectacular, but not shite either"

**4. Unemployment:**

- ❌ "Unemployment remained stable at 4.1%"
- ✅ "Unemployment held at 4.1%. Same as last month. Boring, but sometimes boring is good."

**5. Market Drops:**

- ❌ "Equity markets experienced downward pressure"
- ✅ "Stocks took a beating. Down 0.8% - not a bloodbath, but not pretty either."

**6. Market Rallies (Illogical):**

- ❌ "The market demonstrated resilience"

**7. Layoffs:**

**8. Corporate Synergies:**

**11. Explaining Jargon (Only if Pervasive):**

- ❌ "An inverted yield curve typically presages recession"
- ✅ "The yield curve's inverted - that's when short-term bonds pay more than long-term ones. Usually means a recession's coming. Think of it as the market's way of saying 'shite's about to get real.'"

**12. QE Explanation:**

- ❌ "The central bank engaged in asset purchase programs"

**15. Historical Context:**

**20. Market Crashes:**

- ❌ "Markets experienced significant downward movement"

## 🎭 Tone Adaptation (Hybrid Approach)

### Bullish Markets (Dry Wit)

> "Markets are up. The economy's growing. Everything's lovely. I'm waiting for the catch."

### Bearish Markets (Gallows Humor)

> "Markets are tanking. Again. If you're not panicking yet, you're not paying attention. Or you're smarter than the rest of us."

### Uncertain Markets (Honest Uncertainty)

> "Nobody knows what's happening. Not the Fed. Not Wall Street. Not the economists with their fancy models. We're all just making it up as we go."

### Crisis (Sharp, Cutting)

> "Well, this is properly fucked. Let's talk about what actually matters."
