# Workflow 2: Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Ready to Build

You now have THREE documentation files to guide Workflow 2 implementation:

### 1. Complete Implementation Guide (828 lines)
**File:** `docs/IMPLEMENT-WORKFLOW-2.md`
**Contains:** Full 9-node workflow with HTTP, Playwright, and SearXNG strategies

### 2. Simple Test Version (5 nodes)
**File:** `WORKFLOW-2-SIMPLE-TEST.md`
**Contains:** Minimal implementation to test core flow first

### 3. Quick Start Guide
**File:** `WORKFLOW-2-QUICK-START.md`
**Contains:** Node sequence and quick reference

## üéØ Recommended Build Order

### Step 1: Build Simple Test (5 nodes)
Start with the simplified version to validate core flow:
- Query Airtable
- HTTP scraping
- Update Airtable status

**Time:** ~15-20 minutes  
**File to follow:** `WORKFLOW-2-SIMPLE-TEST.md`

### Step 2: Add AI Processing (expand to ~8 nodes)
Once basic scraping works, add:
- Ollama AI agent
- Parse AI response
- Update all Airtable fields

**Time:** ~20-30 minutes  
**File to follow:** `docs/IMPLEMENT-WORKFLOW-2.md` (Nodes 7-8)

### Step 3: Add Adaptive Strategies (expand to 9+ nodes)
Finally add:
- Switch node for strategy routing
- Playwright scraper (Docker)
- SearXNG fallback

**Time:** ~30-40 minutes  
**File to follow:** `docs/IMPLEMENT-WORKFLOW-2.md` (Nodes 4-6)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Open n8n
2. Create new workflow "Workflow 2 - Content Scraping"
3. Follow `WORKFLOW-2-SIMPLE-TEST.md` to build the 5-node version
4. Test with 1 article first
5. Verify Airtable updates correctly
6. Then expand to full implementation

## üìä Expected Results

After building and running Workflow 2:

- Articles with `Status = needs_scraping` will be processed
- Full content will be scraped and stored in `FullText` field
- Status will change to either:
  - `scraped` (success)
  - `scraping_failed` (will retry with different strategy)
- `ScrapingAttempts` will increment
- `LastScrapingAttempt` will update

## üìù Testing Checklist

- [ ] Query returns articles with `Status = needs_scraping`
- [ ] HTTP request retrieves content
- [ ] Content is cleaned (no HTML tags)
- [ ] Word count is reasonable (100+ words)
- [ ] Airtable updates successfully
- [ ] Status changes to `scraped` or `scraping_failed`
- [ ] Retry logic works (when you add strategy selection)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Build the SIMPLE version first (5 nodes)
- Test with 1 article before batching
- Verify Workflow 1 has created articles with `Status = needs_scraping`
- Check Ollama is running if you add AI processing
- Enable "Typecast" option in Airtable node
