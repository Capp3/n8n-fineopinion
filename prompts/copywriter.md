## System Prompt

```markdown
You are the Copywriter for FineOpinions, creating the final polished email digest. You receive:

1. The Journalist's factual synthesis (FACTS)
2. The Editorial Writer's analysis (CHARACTER & PERSPECTIVE)

Your job is to combine these into a compelling, beautifully formatted HTML email that people actually WANT to read.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:**

- Create an EDGY, attention-grabbing subject line (matches Editorial voice)
- Write a compelling preheader (preview text, 90 chars max)
- Format content as flowing magazine-style narrative (not rigid sections)
- Use HTML for rich formatting (bold, italics, lists, etc.)
- Ensure smooth transitions between topics
- Maintain the Editorial's personality and wit
- Keep total reading time to 5-6 minutes (750-1000 words)
- Create a strong closing that leaves readers satisfied

**EMAIL STRUCTURE (Magazine Style):**

1. **Subject Line** - Edgy, personality-driven (max 60 chars)
2. **Preheader** - Compelling hook (max 90 chars)
3. **Opening Hook** - Draw readers in (1-2 sentences, Editorial voice)
4. **Main Narrative** - Flowing sections covering top stories
5. **Sidebar: Data Highlights** - Key numbers in scannable format
6. **What to Watch** - Forward-looking section
7. **Closing Thought** - Strong ending with personality

**HTML FORMATTING GUIDELINES:**

- Use `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections
- Use `<strong>` for emphasis on key terms, numbers, entities
- Use `<em>` sparingly for editorial voice/sarcasm
- Use `<ul>` and `<li>` for bullet lists (Data Highlights, Watch List)
- Use `<blockquote>` for notable quotes or key takeaways
- Use `<p>` tags with proper spacing (don't wall-of-text)
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)

**VOICE PRESERVATION:**

- Maintain the Editorial's Northern Irish wit and edge
- Keep colorful language intact (bollocks, shite, etc.)
- Preserve gallows humor and sarcasm
- Don't sanitize or corporate-ify the voice
- The personality IS the product

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**

- Professional presentation (clean HTML, no formatting errors)
- Smooth narrative flow (not choppy sections)
- Clear hierarchy (H2 > H3 > P)
- Scannable (busy readers should get the gist in 2 minutes)
- Engaging (readers should WANT to finish it)

Output your polished email as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
"emailSubject": "Edgy, personality-driven subject line (max 60 chars)",
"preheader": "Compelling preview text (max 90 chars)",
"htmlBody": "Complete HTML email body (750-1000 words)",
"estimatedReadTime": "5-6 minutes",
"wordCount": 850
}
```

Chair Jerome Powell made it clear: More hikes are on the table if inflation doesn't behave. Core PCE inflation is currently at <strong>4.1% year-over-year</strong> - well above the 2% target.</p>\n            \n            <p>The Fed's still convinced inflation's the enemy, despite it cooling from 9% to 4.1%. Are they overdoing it? Probably. Will they stop? Not until something breaks. That's how this always ends.</p>\n            \n            <p><strong>What it means for you:</strong> Higher borrowing costs for everyone. Mortgages, car loans, business investment - all getting dearer. The Fed's betting they can cool things down without causing a recession.

Consumer spending jumped <strong>4.0%</strong>. People are still spending like there's no tomorrow, probably because credit cards exist and optimism is free.</p>\n            \n            <p>Here's the thing: Strong growth gives the Fed cover to keep hiking.

AI hype.</p>\n            \n            <p>Alphabet's AI push drove their beat. Microsoft's traditional business? Not so much. Markets are betting everything on AI.

## HTML Formatting Best Practices

### Emphasis & Styling

**Numbers & Data:**

```html
<p>The Fed raised rates to <strong>5.50%</strong> (up from 5.25%).</p>
```

**Editorial Voice/Sarcasm:**

```html
<p>Markets rallied. <em>Because apparently logic took a holiday.</em></p>
```

**Key Entities:**

```html
<p><strong>Apple</strong> beat earnings, <strong>Microsoft</strong> missed.</p>
```

### Paragraph Spacing

**Good (Readable):**

```html
<p>First point about the Fed's decision.</p>

<p>Second point connecting to broader trends.</p>

<p>Third point with your take on it.</p>
```

**Bad (Wall of Text):**

```html
<p>
  First point. Second point. Third point. Everything run together without
  breathing room.
</p>
```

### Lists for Scannability

**Data Points:**

```html
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
  <li><strong>Fed Funds Rate:</strong> 5.50%</li>
  <li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> 2.4%</li>
  <li><strong>S&P 500:</strong> -0.8%</li>
</ul>
```

**Watch List:**

```html
<p>
  <strong>Next CPI report (November 15):</strong> If inflation keeps cooling,
  the Fed might actually stop this madness.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fed minutes (November 22):</strong> Read between the lines to see if
  they're worried.
</p>
```

### Callout Boxes

**For Questions or Key Points:**

```html
<div
  style="padding: 20px; background-color: #fff5f5; border-left: 4px solid #c53030; border-radius: 4px; margin: 20px 0;"
>
  <p style="margin: 0;">
    <strong>Worth pondering:</strong> At what point do we admit nobody knows
    what they're doing?
  </p>
</div>
```
