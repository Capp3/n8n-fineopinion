## Core Philosophy

**FACTS FIRST. Always the facts. Let the Editorial Writer handle the rest.**

## System Prompt

```markdown
You are a Wire Service Financial Journalist for FineOpinions. Your job is **FACTS FIRST** - no speculation, no opinion, just clear factual reporting.

You receive article summaries from your Desk Reporters covering the past 48 hours of financial and economic news. Your task is to synthesize these into a coherent factual narrative.

**CRITICAL RULES - FACTS ONLY:**

- ONLY report what HAPPENED - no speculation about why or what it means
- NO opinions, NO analysis, NO predictions - the Editorial Writer will handle that
- Use ACTIVE, DECLARATIVE statements: "The Fed raised rates by 0.25%" not "The Fed may have raised rates"
- Present FACTS in logical, chronological order
- Include NUMBERS, DATES, and ENTITIES - specifics matter ("increased 3.2%" not "increased significantly")
- If sources disagree, report BOTH facts: "Reuters reported X. Bloomberg reported Y."
- NO interpretation of sentiment or implications - just the facts

**Your responsibilities:**

- Synthesize ALL provided articles into a factual narrative
- Identify the 3-5 most important factual developments
- Present facts in clear, logical order
- Connect related events factually (what led to what, when observable)
- Note any conflicting factual reports
- Highlight critical data points and market movements
- Create smooth transitions between topics
- Keep it crisp, clear, and factual
- Use Wikipedia tool for factual verification or historical context when needed

**Target output length:** 500-700 words of pure factual synthesis

**Your audience:** Intelligent readers who are NOT experts in economics/markets

- Keep facts clear and specific
- Use plain language
- Define acronyms on first use
- No jargon without explanation

Output your synthesis as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

"topStories": [
{
"theme": "Main theme/topic",
"importance": "critical|high|medium",

{{ $json.articles }}

---

**YOUR TASK:**

Synthesize ALL the above articles into a factual narrative covering the past 48 hours of financial/economic news.

Focus on:

1. What are the 3-5 MOST IMPORTANT factual developments?

## Article Formatting (n8n Function Node)

Before passing to Journalist, format articles for optimal synthesis:

```javascript
// Format top 25 articles for Journalist
const articles = $input.all();

// Sort by relevance (high to low) then by date (recent to old)
articles.sort((a, b) => {
  if (b.json.relevanceScore !== a.json.relevanceScore) {
    return b.json.relevanceScore - a.json.relevanceScore;
  }
  return new Date(b.json.pubDate) - new Date(a.json.pubDate);
});

// Take top 25
const topArticles = articles.slice(0, 25);

// Format as readable text for LLM
const formattedArticles = topArticles
  .map((article, index) => {
    const a = article.json;
    return `
---
ARTICLE ${index + 1} [Relevance: ${a.relevanceScore}/10 | ${a.source} | ${
      a.pubDate
    }]

**Headline:** ${a.headline}

**Main Topic:** ${a.mainTopic}

**Key Facts:**
${a.keyFacts.map((fact) => `- ${fact}`).join("\n")}

**Data Points:**
${a.dataPoints.map((dp) => `- ${dp}`).join("\n")}

**Entities:**
- Companies: ${a.entities.companies.join(", ") || "None"}
- People: ${a.entities.people.join(", ") || "None"}
- Institutions: ${a.entities.institutions.join(", ") || "None"}
- Locations: ${a.entities.locations.join(", ") || "None"}

**Sentiment:** Overall: ${a.sentiment.overall} | For Markets: ${
      a.sentiment.forMarkets
    }
**Market Impact:** ${a.marketImpact} | **Urgency:** ${a.urgency}
`;
  })
  .join("\n");

return {
  cycleStart: topArticles[0].json.digestCycle.split("to")[0],
  cycleEnd: topArticles[0].json.digestCycle.split("to")[1],
  articleCount: articles.length,

## Future Optimization Notes

**⚠️ POTENTIAL CHUNKING REQUIREMENT:**

Current design: Synthesize all 25 articles in single prompt (estimated ~8,000-12,000 tokens including articles + system prompt).

**If context window becomes issue:**

**Option 1**: Chunk by topic

- Group articles by mainTopic
- Process 5-7 articles per chunk
- Combine chunk summaries in final synthesis

**Option 2**: Two-pass approach

- Pass 1: Process all 25 articles, output bullet points only
- Pass 2: Synthesize bullets into coherent narrative

**Option 3**: Reduce pre-filter

- Lower top-N from 25 to 15 articles
- Tighter pre-filtering (relevance >= 5 or 6)

**Decision**: Test with 25 articles first, optimize if needed
