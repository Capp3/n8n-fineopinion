    "content": "Beyond supply factors (see US Federal debt: the risks of abundance) and demand factors (see A safe haven put to the test), banking regulations have also contributed to weakening the Treasuries market. This is the subject of the third instalment of our EcoInsight series on Treasuries.Since 2023, the US authorities have taken various measures to support the liquidity and stability of the Treasuries market (greater transparency of transactions, increased use of centralised clearing of repurchase agreements, programme to buy back the least traded securities).However, the balance sheet constraints faced by the banks responsible for intermediating this market remain an aggravating factor in times of stress. To remedy this, on 25 June, regulators proposed relaxing the leverage requirements imposed on systemically important banking groups and their deposit-taking subsidiaries. This measure should restore the leverage ratio's role as a safety net and reassure investors about the ability of banks to fully perform their role as intermediaries. However, the respite offered may be short-lived given the projected evolution of federal debt. The relaxation of the leverage ratio could even inadvertently support the strategies of leveraged funds, thereby reinforcing some of the vulnerabilities that regulators are specifically seeking to mitigate.",

    "content": "Following on from the first part of our EcoInsight series on US Treasuries, which focused on the US administration's budget plans (US federal debt: the risks of abundance),  this second part we are examining how president Trumps’ excesses have harmful effects on the demand for federal paper.The profile of US Federal Government creditors has changed significantly over the past 20 years. The appeal of Treasuries for so-called ‘long-term’ investors (i.e. foreign central banks, resident pension funds and insurers) has waned. More ‘short-term’ investors (i.e. leveraged funds), who favour procyclical strategies, are now very active in this market. This shift has contributed to undermining the safe-haven status of Treasuries, which are now more sensitive to periods of stress.Admittedly, the interest of money market funds, the Federal Reserve and stablecoin issuers in short-term securities (T-bills) could support the US Treasury's issuance programme over the coming quarters. Nevertheless, investor confidence could be undermined by the current climate of uncertainty. This is due to rumours of taxation of non-residents in return for the ‘privilege’ of holding dollars as reserve assets, threats to the Fed's independence and its dollar loans to foreign central banks.The third part of our series will analyse why easing leverage standards, which was initiated under Donald Trump, will only offer short-term relief.",
