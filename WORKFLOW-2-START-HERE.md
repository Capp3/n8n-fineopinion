# üöÄ Workflow 2: Start Here

## Decision: Use SearXNG First, Selenium as Fallback

Since SearXNG is **already working** for you, let's start with the simplest approach:

1. **Primary:** SearXNG (5 nodes) ‚úÖ
2. **Fallback:** Selenium (if needed) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üéØ Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option A: SearXNG Only (Simplest - RECOMMENDED)

**File:** `docs/WORKFLOW-2-SEARXNG-FIRST.md`

**Steps:**
1. Open n8n
2. Create workflow: "Workflow 2 - Content Scraping"
3. Build 5 nodes:
   - Manual Trigger
   - Airtable Query (Status = needs_scraping)
   - SearXNG Search
   - Code: Parse Results
   - Airtable Update
4. Test with 1 article
5. ‚úÖ Done!

**Time:** ~15 minutes

### Option B: Selenium Setup (More Complex)

**File:** `docs/WORKFLOW-2-SELENIUM-SETUP.md`

**Steps:**
1. Start Selenium: `docker run -d --name selenium_chrome -p 4444:4444 selenium/standalone-chrome:129.0`
2. Create workflow in n8n
3. Build 7-8 nodes (Selenium session management)
4. Test and debug

**Time:** ~30-40 minutes

## üìÅ Documentation Files

| File | Purpose | Complexity |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `docs/WORKFLOW-2-SEARXNG-FIRST.md` | SearXNG-based scraper (5 nodes) | ‚≠ê Simple |
| `docs/WORKFLOW-2-SELENIUM-SETUP.md` | Selenium setup guide | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium |
| `docs/IMPLEMENT-WORKFLOW-2.md` | Full Playwright version (828 lines) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Complex |

## üéØ Recommendation

**Start with SearXNG** (`docs/WORKFLOW-2-SEARXNG-FIRST.md`):

1. It's already working for you
2. Simple 5-node workflow
3. Fast to build and test
4. Add Selenium later if needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

**Before starting:**
- Make sure Workflow 1 has created articles with `Status = needs_scraping` in Airtable
- Verify your SearXNG instance is running
- Have Airtable credentials ready

## üìù Next Steps

1. Follow `docs/WORKFLOW-2-SEARXNG-FIRST.md`
2. Build the 5-node workflow
3. Test with 1 article
4. Share results or issues

Then we can add AI processing (Ollama) if you want.
