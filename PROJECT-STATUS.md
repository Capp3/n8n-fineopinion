## 🎯 Project Overview

**What:** Automated financial news digest with PERSONALITY  
**How:** 4-agent AI pipeline

- Desk Reporter (extract facts)
- Journalist (synthesize facts - NO opinion)
- Editorial Writer (add CHARACTER & FUN - Northern Irish voice)
- Copywriter (polish into HTML email)  
  **When:** Every other day (48-hour news cycle)  
  **Where:** n8n 1.114.4 + Ollama + Airtable  
  **Who:** Intelligent readers, not finance experts  
  **Voice:** Northern Irish wit, edgy, gallows humor allowed

---

## 🔑 Key Design Philosophy

**FACTS FIRST, CHARACTER SECOND:**

- 🗞️ **Journalist** = FACTS ONLY (no speculation, no opinion)
- ✍️ **Editorial** = PERSPECTIVE & FUN (wit, edge, personality)

**This separation ensures:**

- Factual integrity (facts never mixed with opinion)
- Clear voice (readers know what's fact vs. perspective)
- Trust (facts are reliable, opinions are clearly marked)
- Entertainment (financial news can actually be enjoyable!)

---

## 📊 System Specs

- **RSS Sources:** 4 (Economist, Bloomberg, Reuters, MarketWatch)
- **Processing:** Twice daily (7AM/7PM), digest every other day (6AM)
- **Agents:** 4 specialized AI agents
- **Models:** llama3.2:3b (fast) + qwen2.5:7b (quality)
- **Database:** Airtable (2 tables, 40+ fields)
- **Deduplication:** URL hash + title similarity
- **Pre-filter:** Relevance >= 4, top 25 articles to Journalist
- **Target Output:** 750-1000 words, 5-6 minute read, HTML email
- **Voice:** Northern Irish, edgy, professional but fun

---

## 🎉 Major Accomplishments (October 9, 2025)

**Planning & Design:**

- ✅ Complete multi-agent architecture
- ✅ Full system workflow documented
- ✅ Airtable schemas designed
- ✅ Deduplication strategy implemented

**Prompt Engineering (ALL COMPLETE):**

- ✅ Desk Reporter - Fact extraction (305 lines)
- ✅ Journalist - Factual synthesis, Wikipedia tool (424 lines)
- ✅ Editorial - Northern Irish voice with edge (639 lines)
- ✅ Copywriter - HTML formatting (471 lines)

**Documentation:**

- ✅ 1,839 lines of agent prompts
- ✅ 2,500+ lines of architecture docs
- ✅ Comprehensive handoff materials
- ✅ Voice guide with 60+ examples

**Total:** ~4,300 lines of production-ready documentation

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Implementation

1. **Context Window (Journalist):**

   - 25 articles = ~8-12K tokens
   - Test first, implement chunking if needed
   - Strategy documented in `/prompts/journalist.md`

2. **Wikipedia Tool (Journalist Only):**

   - Connect via n8n Agent Node tools connection
   - For factual verification and historical context

3. **Voice Preservation:**

   - Editorial's Northern Irish wit is intentional
   - Copywriter must NOT sanitize the edge
   - Colorful language stays (bollocks, shite, etc.)

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Level 3 audience (assume basic knowledge)
   - Explain advanced concepts only if pervasive
   - Use plain language and analogies
